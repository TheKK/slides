# Key points of Haskell

It's dangerous to go alone! Take these.

- everything is function
  - value is like function without argument, wow
- Haskell is lazy (evaluation) by default
  - I won't focus on this part in this talk
- Haskellers are lazy
  - they don't like repetition
- focus on input, output and types
  - try not to think about variable mutation here

# What does Haskell look like?

Here's my favorite snippet

```haskell
students & sortBy (comparing height)
```

you'll be about to read these after this chapter

<!--
提醒，Haskell 是靜態型別的語言，所以這邊的程式碼都是有固定型別的
-->

---

# Literals

```haskell
42

"hello world"

("egg", 5)

True

["apple", "orange", "banana"]

(\x -> "yes")
```

---

# Function application

```haskell
-- "+" is a function
-- When the function name is "symbol", it's infix function
1 + 2

-- "sum" is a function
-- When the function name is "alphabet", it's prefix function
sum([1, 2, 3])
```

---

# Function application
    
```haskell
-- infix function application
1 + 2

-- chained infix functions application
1 + 2 + 3

-- prefix function application
sum([1, 2, 3])

-- but the parentheses is "optional" in most case
sum [1, 2, 3]

-- no one like parentheses, right?
1 + (2 + 3)

-- more than one argument
mapList (\s -> length s) ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
```

---

# Function application

We'll use this format to display result of expression in the following slides
    
```haskell
1 + 2
> 3

1 + 2 + 3
> 6

sum([1, 2, 3])
> 6

sum [1, 2, 3]
> 6

1 + (2 + 3)
> 6

mapList (\s -> length s) ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
> [5, 6, 6]
```

---

# Function application

Don't forget the lambda expression
    
```haskell
(\x -> x + 1) 41
> 42

(\x y -> x + y) 3 3
> 6

(\x -> "yes") "no"
> "yes"

(\x -> "yes") "I say no!!!"
> "yes"

(\x -> x) "ok"
> "ok"

(\x -> x) [True, True, False]
> [True, True, False]
```

---

# How we write down type of expressions

Type of literals
    
`12 :: Int`, the type of `12` is `Int`

`"Hello" :: String`, the type of `"Hello"` is `String`

`True :: Bool`, the type of `True` is `Bool`

more examples

`("yes", 123) :: (String, Int)`

`[1, 2, 3] :: [Int]`

`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] :: [[Int]]`
 
---

# How we write down type of expressions

Type of functions

You could treat the last type as return type

- lambda expressions have type

`(\a -> a + 1) :: Int -> Int`, argument is `Int`, return type is `Int`

`(\a b -> a + b) :: Int -> Int -> Int`, arguments are `Int` and `Int`, return type is `Int`

- named functions have type as well

`sum :: [Int] -> Int`

`mapStringToLength :: [String] -> [Int]`

---

# Define value in code

```haskell
theAnswer :: Int
theAnswer = 42
```

So basically you tell compiler (or your co-worker):

- what's the type of `theAnswer`
- what's the implementation of `theAnswer`

---

# Define function in code

```haskell
addThree :: Int -> Int
addThree = (\n -> n + 3)
```

So basically you tell compiler (or your co-worker):

- what's the type of `addThree`
- what's the implementation of `addThree`

---

# Define value in code

Looks familiar

```haskell
theAnswer :: Int
theAnswer = 42
```

```haskell
addThree :: Int -> Int
addThree = (\n -> n + 3)
```

For sure, **function** is one kind of **value**

---

# Define function in code

So many possibilities

```haskell
addThree :: Int -> Int
addThree = (\n -> n + 3)
```

To reduce the number of parentheses and arrows, you could define **functoin** in the following form

```haskell
addThree :: Int -> Int -- type is the same
addThree n = n + 3     -- move argument the the left
```

or in elementary school style, if you prefer (yes it's valid syntax)

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int
f(x) = x + 3
```

---

# Simple generic in functions

```haskell
mapStringToInt :: (String -> Int) -> ([String] -> [Int])
```

how to make it more generic? Simple! Make some **type variables**!

```haskell
-- String becomes 'a'
-- Int becomes 'b'
map :: (a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b])
```

Now `a` and `b` could be **any** types. Of course `a` could be the same type as `b`.

---

# Simple generic in functions

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b])

length :: String -> Int
(map length) :: [String] -> [Int]

not :: Bool -> Bool
(map not) :: [Bool] -> [Bool]

toString :: Int -> String
(map toString) :: [Int] -> [String]
```

now `map` is generic that you can map **everything** inside list `[]`

<!--
這裏看看型別
-->

---

# Simple generic in functions, examples

```haskell
(map length) :: [String] -> [Int]
(map not) :: [Bool] -> [Bool]
(map toString) :: [Int] -> [String]

(map length) ["a", "aa", "aaa"]
> [1, 2, 3]

(map not) [True, True, False]
> [False, False, True]

(map toString) [9, 10, 11]
> ["9", "10", "11"]

(map length) ((map toString) [9, 10, 11])
> [1, 2, 2]
```

<!--
這裏看看數值
-->

---

# Go back to this

We've learned enough to read this

```haskell
students & sortBy (comparing height)
```

types of these

```haskell
students :: [Student]

sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> ([a] -> [a])

-- please ignore the weird Ord here.
comparing :: Ord a => (b -> a) -> (b -> b -> Ordering)

height :: Student -> Int

(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
```

---

# Solve this now!

```haskell
students & sortBy (comparing height)
```

```haskell
comparing :: Ord a => (b -> a) -> (b -> b -> Ordering)
height ::        Student -> Int

-- Step 1: "b" is Student, "a" in Int
(comparing height) :: Student -> Student -> Ordering

sortBy ::             (a      -> a       -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]

-- Step 2: "a" is Student
sortBy (comparing height) :: [Student] -> [Student]

students :: [Student]
(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b

-- Step 3: "a" is [Student], "b" is [Student] as well
students & sortBy (comparing height)
```

# REPL

Read–eval–print loop

---

# REPL

You can see result directly

```shell
> ghci
GHCi, version 8.8.4: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loaded GHCi configuration from /home/kk/.ghci,,

> 1 + 41
42

> fmap show [1..10]
["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"]

> not True
False

> length "apple"
5
```

<!--
雖然是靜態型別，但是還是有有 repl
-->

---

# REPL

You can check types of expression

```shell
> :type not True
not True :: Bool

> :type fmap show [1..10]
fmap show [1..10] :: [String]

> :type length "apple"
length "apple" :: Int
```

---

# REPL

You can load any Haskell source code and reload it after editing

```shell
> :load /tmp/Main.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( /tmp/Main.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
> :browse Main
# After some edits
> :reload
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( /tmp/Main.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
> :browse Main
haha :: String
> haha
"hahaha"
```

You don't need to import certain module and running some functions to *partially* reload your module. ([StackOverflow: How do I unload (reload) a Python module?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/437589/how-do-i-unload-reload-a-python-module))

---

# Functions

Haskell loves functions, uses lots of function, and uses them very well

---

# Function is useful and everywhere

Prefix, infix, your choice
    
```haskell
-- "non-symbol" functions are prefix by default
mod 10 3
> 1

-- calling them with `` make them infix
10 `mod` 3
> 1

-- "symbol" functions are infix by default
[1, 2] ++ [3, 4]
> [1, 2, 3, 4]

-- calling them with () make them prefix
(++) [1, 2] [3, 4]
> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

# Function is useful and everywhere

Everyone wants infix function, but they pretend they don't
    
```haskell
numberA `compare` numberB
```

```c#
// C#
// if method is so great, why don't they write "123.add(100)?
123 + 100 // 223
123.CompareTo(100) // 1
```

```rust
// Rust
123 + 100 // 223
123_i32.cmp(&100) // Ordering::Greater
```

Now you know why people sometimes are obsessive about "object", because "method" is actually infix function!

---

# Function is useful and everywhere

Don't like it? Then use function to change it!

```haskell
(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
sort :: [Int] -> [Int]

-- missing the object-like method?
sort [4,3,2,1]

-- no thanks!
[4,3,2,1] & sort
```

---

# Function is useful and everywhere

Like the idea of **TRUE-ZERO-PARENTHESE**?

```haskell
gameCollections :: Set Game
metroidDread :: Game
silksong :: Game

insert :: Game -> (Set Game -> Set Game)

-- oh my
insert silksong (insert metroidDread gameCollections)

-- oh, is that...
gameCollections & insert metroidDread & insert silksong

-- it's method chaining! it's fluent interface!
-- NO! It's just function...
gameCollections
  & insert metroidDread
  & insert silksong
```

---

# Currying

Not Japaness style, not indian style, Haskell style!

---

# Currying

```haskell
-- follows the type, they're all valid expressions
addThreeInt       :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
addThreeInt 1     :: Int -> Int -> Int
addThreeInt 1 2   :: Int -> Int
addThreeInt 1 2 3 :: Int
```

it means that `addThreeInt 1 2` is valild and returns a **function** with type `Int -> Int`!

you don't need to write code below like many other languages

```haskell
-- even though it's still valid in Haskell
(\n -> addThreeInt 1 2 n) 3
```

```javascript
// JavaScript, so many parentheses, is that LispScript?
(n => addThreeInt(1, 2, n)) (3) 
```

---

# Currying

Try to change your point of view, so magicall

```haskell
addThreeStuff :: Int -> Bool -> String -> Int
```

is actually (`->` is right associative)

```haskell
addThreeStuff :: Int -> (Bool -> (String -> Int))
```

so

```haskell
addThreeStuff :: Int -> (Bool -> (String -> Int))
addThreeStuff 1       :: Bool -> (String -> Int)
addThreeStuff 1 False          :: String -> Int
addThreeStuff 1 False "bye"              :: Int
```

---

# Currying

In haskell, currying happends to all functions, and that's useful

```haskell
numbers :: [Int]
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

-- too many words
filter (\n -> n < 10) numbers

-- that's good
filter (< 10) numbers
```

It's not that useful at a glance, but it'll be annoying quickly when you have to write down function argument every time.

---

# Data

how do we define & construct data?

---

# Data - declare them

Like enum

```haskell
-- Define a type named MyBool
data MyBool = MyTrue | MyFalse

-- And you'll get following functions automatically

-- MyTrue  :: MyBool
-- MyFalse :: MyBool
```

It's like `enum` in most language

`MyBool` is either `MyTrue` or `MyFalse`

---

# Data - declare them

Like struct

```haskell
-- Define a type named Person
data Person = Person Int String

-- And you'll get following functions automatically
-- I know it's confusing, but
-- one Person is *function*, the other is *type*

-- Person :: Int -> String -> Person
```

It's like `struct` in most language

`Person` stores two field, `Int` and `String`

---

# Data - declare them

More like struct

```haskell
-- Define a type named Person
data Person = Person
  { age  :: Int
  , name :: String
  }

-- And you'll get following functions automatically

-- Person :: Int -> String -> Person

-- age  :: Person -> Int
-- name :: Person -> String
```

It's like `struct` in most language, with field accessor

---

# Data - mix them

We want both

```haskell
-- Define a type named Shape
data Shape
  = Circle { radius :: Int }
  | Rectangle { width :: Int , height :: Int }

-- And you'll get following functions automatically

-- Circle    :: Int -> Shape
-- Rectangle :: Int -> Int -> Shape

-- radius :: Circle -> Int
-- width  :: Rectangle -> Int
-- height :: Rectangle -> Int
```

---

# Data - generic

We don't have billion-dollar mistake

```haskell
-- Define a type named Maybe
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

-- And you'll get following functions automatically

-- Nothing :: Maybe a
-- Just    :: a -> Maybe a

Just "do it" :: Maybe String
```

It's like `null pointer` in most language, but you **CAN'T** dereference it randomly

---

# Type inference

Statically typed does not need to be verbose

---

# Type inference

Start from Map

```haskell
data Map k a

empty  :: Map k a 
insert :: Ord k => k -> a -> Map k a -> Map k a
(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
```

```haskell
-- The type of expression below is Map Bool String
empty
  & insert True "yes"
  & insert False "no"
```

Why there's no `Bool`, `Map` or `String` in our code and it still compiled !

<!--
靜態型別的語言不是應該型別寫地到處都是嗎
-->

---

# Type inference

Static enough

```haskell
data Map k a

empty  :: Map k a 
insert :: Ord k => k -> a -> Map k a -> Map k a
```

```haskell
empty
  & insert True "yes"
  & insert False "no"
```

- `insert` in our code takes `Bool` and `String` as arguments
- `insert :: Bool -> String -> Map Bool String -> Map Bool String`
- so the compiler knows `empty` should return `Map Bool String`
- and the compiler knows everything it needs

---

# Type inference

Lessons

- if a programing language is well designed, it could be robust yet clean
- statically typed doesn't means verbose and ceremony code
  - that's caused by your bad design, not by static type
- the most popluar solution is not always the optimal one
  - Bandwagon effect

# Pattern matching

now we have data, time to destruct them

---

# Pattern matching

The enum type

```haskell
data MyBool = MyTrue | MyFalse

boolToString :: MyBool -> String
boolToString myBool = case myBool of
  MyTrue  -> "my true"
  MyFalse -> "my false"
```

We use `case <expr> of` to *destruct* our data

Then *transform* them into other type of data

---

# Pattern matching

The struct type

```haskell
data Person = Person Int String

personToString :: Person -> String
personToString p = case p of
  Person age name -> name
```
```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

maybeStringToString :: Maybe String -> String
maybeStringToString ms = case ms of
  Just s  -> s
  Nothing -> ""
```

---

# Too boring? Check this out!

---

# Pattern matching

```haskell
someLogic :: (Bool, Bool, Bool) -> String
someLogic bs = case bs of
  (True,    _,     _) -> "a"
  (   _, True,  True) -> "b"
  (   _,    _, False) -> "c"
```

`_` means the hold could be either `True` or `False`

Can you tell which case is missing?

---

# Pattern matching

```haskell
someLogic :: (Bool, Bool, Bool) -> String
someLogic bs = case bs of
  (True,    _,     _) -> "a"
  (   _, True,  True) -> "b"
  (   _,    _, False) -> "c"
```

anyhow, the Haskell compiler could find it out instantly

```
Main.hs:2:16: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
    Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
    In a case alternative: Patterns not matched: (False, False, True)
  |
2 | someLogic bs = case bs of
  |                ^^^^^^^^^^...
```

---

# Pattern matching

It's a blessing to be able to write program like table and let compiler has your back

```haskell
someLogic :: (Bool, Bool) -> String
someLogic bs = case bs of
  (True, True)   -> "a"
  (True, False)  -> "b"
  (False, False) -> "c"
  (False, True)  -> "d"
```

```cpp
string some_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  if (a) {
    if (b) { return "a"; }
    else { return "b"; }
  } else {
    if (b) { return "c"; }
    else { return "d"; }
  }
}
```

---

# IO, side effects

Wake up, we have a **RealWorld** to burn

---

# IO

Hello World

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

-- Every Haskell program start from here
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World"

-- Running this program and you'll get
-- "Hello World" on your console
```

pretty short, huh

---

# IO

Hello World, explanation

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

- `()` is empty tuple, it's like `void` in some language
  - you could call it **unit** in Haskell
- `IO a` is a generic data type
  - `a` could be anything
- `IO ()` means: do some side effects and produce a unit
- writing a Haskell program is like: chain lots of `IO` together to produce the final `IO ()` and run it

---

# IO

How to connect them?

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
(<>) :: String -> String -> String

main :: IO ()
main = ???
```

- `IO String` means: do some side effects and produce a String

But how could us access the `String` from `getLine`, preppend it with "Hello, " then print it on screen?

---

# IO

Time for ">>="

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
(<>) :: String -> String -> String

-- > > =
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

-- if we let "a" as String, "b" as ()...
(>>=) :: IO String -> (String -> IO ()) -> IO ()
```

we could now connect them together

```haskell
getLine >>= \name -> putStrLn ("Hello, " <> name) :: IO ()
```

<!--
讀你的名字，跟你說你好
-->

---

# >>=, now you know the reason

<logos-haskell-icon class="text-6xl" />

<!--
like H, like lambda, like >>=
-->

---

# IO

Greet to many of my friends (no joke, it's valid code)

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
(<>) :: String -> String -> String
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

main :: IO ()
main =
  getLine >>= \firstFriend ->
    getLine >>= \secondFriend ->
      getLine >>= \thirdFriend ->
        putStrLn ("Hello 1, " <> firstFriend) >>= \() ->
          putStrLn ("Hello 2, " <> secondFriend) >>= \() ->
            putStrLn ("Hello 3, " <> thirdFriend)
```

who on earth would write code like this!!!

---

# LispScript - Promise

Not lisp, but like lisp

```javascript
var getUUID = () =>
  fetch('https://httpbin.org/uuid')
    .then(r => r.json()).then(j => j.uuid)
    
var showOnConsole = str => new Promise(resolve => {
  console.log(str); resolve();
})

var main = () =>
  getUUID().then(uuidA =>
    getUUID().then(uuidB =>
      getUUID().then(uuidC =>
        showOnConsole("Hello 1, " + uuidA).then(() =>
          showOnConsole("Hello 2, " + uuidB).then(() =>
            showOnConsole("Hello 3, " + uuidC)
  ))))) // << See, it is Lisp
```


<!--
恭喜！如果你會寫 LispScript，拿你就會寫 Haskell 了
-->

---

# IO - do notation

The very first "syntax sugar"

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
(<>) :: String -> String -> String
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

main :: IO ()
main = do
  firstFriend <- getLine
  secondFriend <- getLine
  thirdFriend <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Hello 1, " <> firstFriend)
  putStrLn ("Hello 2, " <> secondFriend)
  putStrLn ("Hello 3, " <> thirdFriend)
```

who on earth would transform code into this!!!

<!--

# JavaScript - Async/Await

# IO, error handling

Something went wrong and you have to do something

---

# IO - error handling

Exception

In Haskell, every `IO a` might throw exception during execution.

The exception mechanism here is no different from other popular programing language

- you can throw desired excpetion when needed
- exception would propagate automatically
- you can catch specific exception and try to recover it, stop the propagation

---

# Breaking news

Here comes a new data type!

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
```

Examples: 

- `Either a b` is either `a` or `b`
- `Either Apple Orange` is either `Apple` or `Orange`
- `Either IOError FileHandle` is either `IOError` or `FileHandle`

<!--
看似很簡單對吧，但是多數的流行語言卻沒有辦法好好表達這種 AB 擇一的資料結構
-->

---

# IO - error handling

try, catch, finally

we need only functions, no extra keywords required

```haskell
try :: Exception e => IO a -> IO (Either e a)
